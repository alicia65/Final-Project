# Doll Database Application

## Doll database application is an OneStop doll information database. 
It is an user-friendly application where doll lovers can explore and learn more about their interesting dolls.

## Features
* Search button
* Add button
* Update button
* Delete button
* Done button

## How to run code
User selects a button of choices. For example, if user wanted to add dolls to database
because this particularly doll is not found in the database. User types doll name and type 
and clicks on the add button. New doll information will be stored in database. 

## Known bugs
Search button might have some bugs. I am still working on these buttons: Search, Update and Delete. They are not working 
as planned.  My GUI shows two displays: JOptionPane and textField for search button.   

## For improvement
I would like to improve on designing a(n) better search, update and delete buttons. They are on the GUI but are not functionally. 
Furthermore, I will add doll image ions, address multiple languages, reduce buttons to three, remove textFields, and hide JTable 
for better layout.  Likewise, I would like to understand more about components before using them, and use better code strategies to enhance 
the doll app in future.
